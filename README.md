## Part 1: Logical Foundations

1. [Naturals](1.LogicalFoundations/1.1.Naturals): Natural numbers
1. Induction: Proof by Induction
1. Relations: Inductive definition of relations
1. Equality: Equality and equational reasoning
1. Isomorphism: Isomorphism and Embedding
1. Connectives: Conjunction, disjunction, and implication
1. Negation: Negation, with intuitionistic and classical logic
1. Quantifiers: Universals and existentials
1. Decidable: Booleans and decision procedures
1. Lists: Lists and higher-order functions

## Part 2: Programming Language Foundations

1. Lambda: Introduction to Lambda Calculus
1. Properties: Progress and Preservation
1. DeBruijn: Intrinsically-typed de Bruijn representation
1. More: Additional constructs of simply-typed lambda calculus
1. Bisimulation: Relating reduction systems
1. Inference: Bidirectional type inference
1. Untyped: Untyped lambda calculus with full normalization
1. Confluence: Confluence of untyped lambda calculus
1. BigStep: Big-step semantics of untyped lambda calculus

## Part 3: Denotational Semantics

1. Denotational: Denotational semantics of untyped lambda calculus
1. Compositional: The denotational semantics is compositional
1. Soundness: Soundness of reduction with respect to denotational semantics
1. Adequacy: Adequacy of denotational semantics with respect to operational semantics
1. ContextualEquivalence: Denotational equality implies contextual equivalence
